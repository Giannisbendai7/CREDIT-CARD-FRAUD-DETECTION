# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
How to handle imbalanced data in real-world financial datasets  The importance of choosing the right metrics  How to interpret confusion matrices and ROC curves  The trade-off between recall and precision in high-risk domains like finance
 4. Evaluation Metrics:
"Given the imbalanced nature of the data, I focused on precision, recall, and the F1-score â€” especially for the minority class (fraud). Accuracy alone would be misleading."

ðŸ“Œ 5. Results:
"The Random Forest model gave me over 99% precision and 80% recall for fraud detection, which is critical in reducing false negatives."
